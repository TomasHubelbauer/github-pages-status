# GitHub Pages Status

This is a list of GitHub Pages that I have enabled for my repos. Some of them
use custom domains. This repository is an automated evergreen list of them and
it also continuously checks them for liveness.

## To-Do

### Collect the Pages using `github-api`

Use a token capable of reading both public and private repos because private
repos can have public Pages.

### Digest the list in the readme

### Add a health check for each of the Pages

Check for a 200 response.

### Add other own sites I wish the health checks for
